2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Once deployed, you'll receive a URL like `https://your-project.vercel.app`
   - Click the URL to visit your deployed application
   - Test wallet connection and basic functionality

   {
     "headers": [
       {
         "source": "/(.*)",
         "headers": [
           {
             "key": "X-Frame-Options",
             "value": "DENY"
           },
           {
             "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
             "value": "nosniff"
           },
           {

     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Error Tracking**
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
   - Configure alerts for critical errors

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular database backups (if applicable)
   - Code repository backups via GitHub

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
   - Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly

2. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Check that variables are added to all environments
   - Redeploy after adding new variables

3. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Verify WalletConnect Project ID is correct
   - Check RPC URL is accessible
   - Ensure chain ID matches your configuration

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Enable Vercel's Edge Network
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Use Vercel's Image Optimization

### Debug Commands

```bash
